### Why we exist.

We are a small group of members and contributors that hold the processes and agreements for usage of the Enspiral brand.

* Our work is to hold understanding and opinion around the context, the potential and risk associated with formally using the Enspiral brand.
* Our work is to help the network build shared understanding and agreements about how we use (and don't use) the Enspiral brand.

We hold the [Brand Agreement](/agreements/brand.md), which allows anyone to use the Enspiral brand alongside their project.

**When the BWG is successful....**

Everyone in the network is clear on the brand agreements and feels confident making the most of the brand.

The Enspiral brand is helping increase the positive impact of the network and everyone in it.

The brand governance structures reflect our community of high trust and strategic, impactful intent.


### Humans

Our goal is to have a group of 6-8 mixed members and contributors who have some professional background or interest in marketing / branding.
