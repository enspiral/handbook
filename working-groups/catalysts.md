# Catalysts working group

We are a working group focused on supporting and coordinating people working to improve Enspiral.

If you have ideas for improving Enspiral, or you want to know what people are doing then feel free to check in with us, we're here to help.

Current catalysts are: Susan Basterfield, Richard Bartlett, and Joshua Vial.


## Our commitments to the network

* maintain the [the Improvements board](https://waffle.io/enspiral/improvements).
* notice and suggest things that need improving
* hold a fortnightly sprint rhythm and invite participation from the network
* provide assistance and support to working groups and individuals working to improve Enspiral

We try to take notes in all our meetings, and share them in the Slack channel [#wg-catalysts](https://enspiral.slack.com/messages/wg-catalysts/).


## Our strategy

In chemistry, a Catalyst is an agent of change, used in small amounts relative to the reactants, which reduces the amount of energy required to create a reaction, and activates the rest of the system without itself getting consumed.

Our goal is to maintain a rhythm of evolution at Enspiral by inviting contribution, participation, and action, whilst reducing the friction people encounter trying to make changes and improvements.


## What are we doing

Sensing community needs, initiating responses, handing them off wherever possible.

* Sense-making and maintaining context.
* We help [working groups](index.md) to form.
* We encourage people to contribute, e.g. by matching people to opportunities, or inviting individuals to contribute on specific tasks.
* We maintain an overview of all the working groups in the network so we can help direct people's energy and attention.

*TODO: share example of working group formation, e.g. the stewardship project*
