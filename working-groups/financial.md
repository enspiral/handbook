# Financial Working Group
_[Status](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RQrZE_9iw0ewIj7UCvC7SBLCziYwfi13vM5FbRDBCx4/edit?usp=sharing): Hibernating_

## Scope
The Financial Working Group (FWG) was [proposed by the Board](https://www.loomio.org/d/oFN6x8t5/comment/1173545) in Nov 2016 to help distribute responsibility for finances to the wider network, provide greater transparency and more ways to get involved, and to keep [the board](https://handbook.enspiral.com/board.html) minimal. The FWG takes recommendations from the board and helps to operationalize them, liases with the board (which oversees financial solvency and compliance) and [Enspiral Ops](https://handbook.enspiral.com/ops-scope.html) regarding recommendations and ideas from the wider Enspiral network, and works on general improvements to Enspiral's financial operations and transparency.

Discretion: the FWG is not a decision-making group, but rather helps to operationalize decisions made according to Enspiral's [core agreements and normal decision-making processes](https://handbook.enspiral.com/agreements.html). In particular, it does not make decisions about spending, unless a particular scope has been given according to the above-mentioned processes. But it can be given mandate to _implement_ decisions made by the board or network, as appropriate.

Examples include

* [Amounts and Allocations of individual Enspiral Contributions](https://www.loomio.org/d/l6ORyPuh/simplifying-the-amount-and-allocation-of-individual-enspiral-contributions)
* New approaches to financial reporting for the network (in progress)
* Process design and compliance for recurring memberships and one-off contributions, to allow greater flexibility in financial contributions from contributors and friends of the network (in progress).

### Get involved
Join the slack channel and let us know what tickles you. We're also very open to hearing your observations about things that could work better, and (constructive) gripes. 

## Communications and Rhythm
* Slack channel: `#wg-financial`
* Task tracking: we use the Improvements board for task tracking. [Here are the tickets](https://waffle.io/enspiral/improvements?label=wg-financial) for the Financial Working Group (labeled wg-financial).
  * It's possible we won't keep the Improvements board entirely up to date. If in doubt, holler in `#wg-financial` on slack with any questions about current projects. 
* Rhythm: we keep an eye on financial happenings in the network, discuss their finer points and implications, and activate on a case-by-case basis based on inbound requests and our own observations.

## Reporting
* Our main slack channel is public
* Feedback is solicited in other channels as appropriate
* Loomio posts are made in accordance with any formal decisions proposed
