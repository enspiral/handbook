### Why we exist.

We are a small group of members and contributors committed to our yearly gatherings.

* Our work is to care for the heartbeat of Enspiral.
* Our work is to create and hold space for connection and cultivation and nurturance, to ground our work and give it wings.

## Membership and Participation

Each gathering will typically have its own project group, _or "pod", in Enspiral jargon_. The core members of this Working Group are committed to participate in the pods for the next two gatherings \(Winter Retreat 2019 and Summer Fest 2020\) and seek to establish the foundations for future retreat pods to better and more easily run our key gatherings. This also means cultivating a sustainable Working Group and planning for our own succession.

### Current Core Members

* john gieryn
* Doris Zuur

### Other Members

* Lucia Die Gil \(Summer Fest 2020, possibly Winter Retreat 2019\)
* Melina Chan \(Summer Fest 2020\)
* Joshua Vial \(Summer Fest 2020\)

### Get involved

We are always open for input, be it feedback observations about things that could work better, or \(constructive\) gripes.

The window for joining a gatherings pod opens well in advance of each gathering; these announcements are posted to our slack channel and typically into Working Groups subgroup of Loomio or the network-wide one.

## Communications and Rhythm
