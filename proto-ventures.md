# Proto-Ventures

As you can read in the [Venture agreement](/agreements/venture.html), proto-ventures are entities considering becoming Enspiral Ventures in the future. They are likely to be:

* Early-stage initiatives connected to people in the network, but are not yet ready to define their team, structure, or model enough to become a full-fledged venture, or
* Established external companies exploring the possibility of joining as Enspiral Ventures

Here’s the process for someone considering starting a proto-venture:

1. At least one of your people need to be Enspiral contributors (see the [People agreement](/agreements/people.html))
2. Find your three stewards
3. Work with your stewards to fill in the [Venture Introduction template](/venture_introduction_template.html)
4. Your stewards will start a Loomio thread to introduce the proto-venture to the network

You’re expected to keep the network updated with progress. As a bare minimum you should meet with your stewards once per quarter and fill in the [venture update form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/11Oz-HM1Wt8CbzxZpzGmjjFcd-sp9vahoqcLuL3UysT4/viewform), which all the ventures use as a lightweight quarterly reporting system.

As your proto-venture matures, at some stage you’ll either want to go all-in and become a full venture, or cancel the relationship with Enspiral. Either way, the process is laid out in the Joining and Leaving sections in the [Venture agreement](/agreements/venture.html).
