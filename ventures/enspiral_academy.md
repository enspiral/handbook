**Founding Date & Brief History**

Rohan and JV were running a tech recruiting business in 2013 and saw first hand the shortage of tech talent in Wellington. JV knew the founder of [Dev Bootcamp](http://www.devbootcamp.com) from working together on Bettermeans who agreed to license the curriculum and business model. We opened enrollments in December 2013, raised 100k of debt and ran the first cohort in May 2014.

**Legal structure**

Limited Liability Company with Rohan and JV as the sole shareholders with a commitment to transfer to a collective ownership structure in a capped returns model once the company membership is strong enough. Current aim is for 2017.

**Business Model**

Our primary customers are people switching careers, though we have had a few school leavers go through the course. Students pay tuition and some employers make a small contribution when they hire a graduate. We don't receive any government funding or subsidies though are exploring opportunities to make that possible.

**Social Impact Strategy / Theory of Change**

* Tech as the biggest exporter of NZ
  * Increase the size and quality of our talent pool
  * Continuous professional development
* Population Parity in tech 
  * Help more women become programmers
  * Help more Maori become programmers
* Regional economic development in NZ
  * More high paying jobs outside of our main cities
* Transforming NZs education sector
  * Cost effective and relevant tertiary education
  * Better tech education in schools
  * Treat people like people and train the whole human
  * Education that is integrated with the wider industry/community
