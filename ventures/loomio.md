**Quarterly Update**

July 2016

* We're moving into "just ship it" mode as we test if there is a viable SaaS business model that can sustain Loomio.

**Founding Date & Brief History**

Loomio Cooperative was founded in August 2012. Loomio emerged from a collective need for more effective tools for collaborative decision-making felt by people at Enspiral and activists involved with the Occupy movement in 2011.


**Legal structure**

Loomio Cooperative Ltd is a limited liability company, that is also a registered worker-owned cooperative. Loomio is owned by its ten worker-members, with 18 impact investors holding redeemable preference shares.

**Business Model**

Loomio has a SaaS subscription model, where customers pay a monthly fee per group. We also have a gift plan for groups without the budget to pay for a subscription. 

**Social Impact Strategy / Theory of Change**

We’re building Loomio because we believe that increasing the organising capacity of lots of small groups of committed people can create big change.

If we can help break the tradeoff between effectiveness and inclusion, then we’ll see more engaged communities, more effective activism, more human-centered workplaces, and more participatory government.
