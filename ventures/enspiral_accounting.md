**Business Model**

We focus on clients who are social enterprises, startups or not for profits organisations.
We have a passion for organisations working to make a positive difference – in their communities and society at large. In the end, our business is all about them – helping them to do good and do well. We do take on a range of clients and have the  option of a discount we can offer as part of our social mission. Our Revenue streams are from our accounting services and we leave 30% of invoices within the company, 5% of which is paid to Enspiral Foundation and contractors/accountants are paid the remaining 70%. We have most clients on a monthly subscription which gives us certaining of income and helps with financial sustainability. 


**Social Impact Strategy / Theory of Change**

Our hearts are with helping NFPs, Charities and Social Enterprises succeed with their own social mission. The small thing we can do to help them succeed is by providing them with awesome accounting advice and support. That’s why we offer these organisations the chance to “choose your own discount”.

But how can we afford to do this? Quite simply for every business which signs up to our monthly subscription package, this helps fund us to provide social organisations with discounted services. So basically by paying your accounting fee, you’re helping out another organisation!
