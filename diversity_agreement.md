# Diversity Agreement

{{book.org}} is committed to developing and fostering a culture of diversity within an equitable workplace where all people are respected and valued. {{book.org}} will take active steps to reflect the diversity of the communities it works in. This policy provides a framework to which all other policies should align. It provides direction to everyone at {{book.org}}.

{{book.org}} will better reach its overall goals if it is successful in systematically identifying and removing barriers to full participation in all aspects of our work. Increasing diversity has been consistently shown to help business succeed. It is essential for reaching both our financial and social goals.

**{{book.org}} will:**
* be guided by the principle that equity means more than treating people in the same way; it requires special measures and the accommodation of differences.
* advocate for learning and development opportunities to raise awareness and build understanding of equity and diversity in practice.
* not tolerate discriminatory behaviour, such as harassment, name-calling, and disparaging jokes, and will take responsibility for appropriately addressing such incidents.
* include a commitment to diversity in the selection process for who we bring into our community.

It is the responsibility of everyone at {{book.org}} to ensure that we uphold its principles of equity and diversity in all its practices.
