# Financial Transparency

**Note: This page is still in progress**

How money works at Enspiral is determined by the [Financial Agreement](http://handbook.enspiral.com/financial_agreement.html). This page is to provide information and transparency about our financial situation.

### Income
The following information is reasonably accurate as of October 2016. [source](https://www.loomio.org/d/9kpIaK6W/cooking-the-books-paying-for-google-accounts-)

Enspiral Foundation income comes from both Ventures and Contributors

__Venture__ contributions:

| $ | From |
|---|---|
|700 | Lifehack |
| 500 | EDA |
| 400 | Accounting |
| 200 | Loomio |
| 200  | Rabid |
| 100 | Ops |
| 40  | ActionStation |

__Contributors__ pay an annual fee averaging at about $100 per person. Half of this is allocated by contributors using Cobudget - I've listed this as an expense below.

So Foundation __monthly income__ is:

| $ | source |
|---|---|
| 2090 | ventures |
| 1833 | contributors |
| 3923 | __total__ |


### Emergency Fund
*Amount set aside by the Board of Directors*

$10,000

### Normal Reserves
*Spending these funds is a decision of the Enspiral Members*

$14,000

### Fixed Costs

*Expenses we have collectively agreed to fund on an ongoing basis.*

| $ | thing |
|---|---|
| 3200 | Enspiral Ops ([scope](ops-scope.html))|
| 916 | Cobudget |
| 900 | Google |
| 480 | Comms ([scope](comms-role.html)) |
| 350 | ACC |
| 5846 | __total__ |
