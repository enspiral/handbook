# Financial Transparency

**Note: This page is accurate as of October 2016 **

How money works at Enspiral is determined by the [Financial Agreement](http://handbook.enspiral.com/financial_agreement.html). This page is to provide information and transparency about our financial situation.
## Income and Expenses

### Income
Enspiral Foundation income comes from both Ventures and Contributors

__Venture__ contributions:

| $ | From |
|---|---|
| 1.5k - 2.5k | Services |
| 700 | Lifehack |
| 500 | EDA |
| 400 - 650 | Accounting |
| 200 | Loomio |
| 200  | Rabid |
| 100 | Ops |
| 40  | ActionStation |

__Contributors__ pay an annual fee averaging at about $100 per person. Half of this is allocated by contributors using Cobudget - I've listed this as an expense below.

So Foundation __monthly income__ is:

| $ | source |
|---|---|
| 2090 | ventures |
| 1833 | contributors |
| 3923 | __total__ |

### Expenses

*Expenses we have collectively agreed to fund on an ongoing basis.*

| 480 | Comms ([scope](comms-role.html)) |
| 350 | ACC |
| 5846 | __total__ |
