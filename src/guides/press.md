## FAQ

### What should I do if someone asks to interview me?

My take is always to accept interviews, but take some safeguards: Ask to be allowed to record it yourself. Start by interviewing them, so that you have a picture of where they are at with the story and which course they intends to steer it. If your guts tell you to trust them then tell your story. If not, politely excuse yourself saying that your work goes on a different direction that is not connected to that story.

Offer to help further, and without pushing for it, show availability to read their take on the interview before publishing. Most journalists feel nervous about that.
