[_Status_](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RQrZE_9iw0ewIj7UCvC7SBLCziYwfi13vM5FbRDBCx4/edit?usp=sharing)_: Merging with Kumara Node__

### Why we exist.

We are a small group of members and contributors committed to our yearly gatherings and – increasingly – all of Enspiral's vital gatherings, year round.

* Our work is to care for the heartbeat of Enspiral.
* Our work is to create and hold space for connection and cultivation and nurturance, to ground our work and give it wings.
* Our work is essentially manaakitanga \([defined here as](https://maoridictionary.co.nz/search?idiom=&phrase=&proverb=&loan=&histLoanWords=&keywords=manaakitanga) hospitality, kindness, generosity, support…\) and the work that creates the conditions in which another's mana may grow.

## Membership and Participation

Each gathering will typically have its own crew, or "project group". The core members of this Working Group are committed to participate in the pods for the next two gatherings \(Winter Retreat 2019 and Summer Fest 2020\) and seek to establish the foundations for future retreat pods to better and more easily run our key gatherings. This also means cultivating a sustainable Working Group and planning for our own succession.

### Current Core Members

### Get involved

We are always open for input, be it feedback observations about things that could work better, or \(constructive\) gripes.

The window for joining a gatherings pod opens well in advance of each gathering; these announcements are posted to our slack channel and typically into Working Groups subgroup of Loomio or the network-wide one.

## Communications and Rhythm

## Reporting

* Every yearly gathering has a report
