# Nodes

This chapter compiles existing Enspiral Nodes.

An Enspiral node is a formal subgroup of Enspiral that has the power to manage their agreements, processes and finances independently.

If you want to start a node in Enspiral, a good place to start is reading the [Node Agreement](/agreements/nodes) which outlines all the formal requirements to get officially approved by the board. You might also benefit from the documentation of the existing nodes, and having a conversation with their representatives. Good luck âœ¨
