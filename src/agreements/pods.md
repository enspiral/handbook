# Pods Agreement

_This agreement is about how we distribute the support and care tasks in the network and replaces the_ [_former Stewardship Agreement_](https://www.loomio.org/d/RIMCfuaT/) _in this respect._

Pods are small groups of people \(4 to 5 is suggested\) formed by people in Enspiral. Why Pods? It is important to distribute the tasks of _supporting and caring for each other_ – and _building relationships_ – around the network in a structured way. If you want to give and receive care in this network, then you have a responsibility to make that happen. Pods are one way in which the network is formally committed to supporting you in this. It's a good place to start, and this agreement ensures that a Pods Working Group will exist to facilitate that for you.

The Pods Working Group \(Pods WG\) is accountable for hosting the Pods formation process on a regular basis, once or more per year and communicating updates with the Network which could include status, progress and learnings.

For information about how we implement Pods, see the [Pods Guide](../guides/pods.md).
