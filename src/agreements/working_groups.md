Working groups are the way we build and maintain Enspiral, if Enspiral were a body, working groups would be the organs.

## Types of Working Groups

There are three types of working groups: informal, formal and financially enabled.

### Informal

An informal working group is the easiest to start, it requires no approval and only needs at least two members to qualify as a working group.

* Any two people can start an informal working group for any purpose they define.
* It can be for a short lived project or long term mission.
* The working group can set its own rules for who can join.

### Formal

A formal working group is a more robust working group with additional powers and responsibilities.

* Catalyst approval is required to create a formal working group.
* Only formal working groups can be delegated responsibilities or powers in an Agreement.

### Financial Enabled

A financially enabled working group is able to use the Enspiral Foundation Ltd as a financial and legal platform. They can use the company to receive, spend and hold money and enter into legal contracts.

* Board approval is required to create a financially enabled working group.
* Financially enabled working groups operate an autonomous business unit within the Enspiral Foundation Ltd.
