# Board of Directors

As a registered New Zealand company, Enspiral Foundation Ltd has to have directors. Enspiral’s goal is to distribute vision, strategy, and leadership as widely as possible in the network, so the board has a narrow focus. You can see the details in the [Board Agreement](https://handbook.enspiral.com/agreements/board).

_With recent changes to Enspiral membership and emergence of [nodes](/agreements/nodes.md) the role of the board in the network is currently in transition._

**Responsibilities**

* Legal and financial compliance
* Management of major risk
* Steward of the Enspiral brand

**Activities**

* Oversee the Foundation’s financial accounts
* Make agreements between the Enspiral Foundation and other entities \(MOUs, Service contracts\)
* Occasionally make recommendations or raise issues to the members or the network as a whole
* Approve the formation of new [nodes](/agreements/nodes.md) of the network
* Have some emergency powers to use in rare crisis situations if our other processes have broken down

**Reporting**

The board reports regularly to the network as a whole [on Loomio](https://www.loomio.org/d/oFN6x8t5/re-introducing-the-enspiral-foundation-mvb-board-of-directors-), and participates quarterly venture reporting \(since Enspiral Foundation Ltd is itself an Enspiral Venture\).

**Scope**

The scope board is that the scope is limited - the board specifically focuses on Enspiral Foundation Ltd \(not the entire Enspiral network\), and within that only governance.

Examples of things within scope:

* an MOU between the Enspiral Foundation and an external organisation
* an issue with one of the Foundation’s service contracts \(such as Enspiral Ops\)
* a serious concern about brand or reputation risk, or if you’re unsure when it’s OK to use Enspiral’s brand publicly
* a question about running a transaction through the Foundation’s bank account
