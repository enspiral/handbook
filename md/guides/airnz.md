# Attributing your "Organisation Airpoints" to Enspiral

### Context

There is a special way of contributing funds to Enspiral that does not involve money. You can contribute so-called “Airpoints” through Air New Zealand’s frequent flyer program. These airpoints could help the Commons to pay flight tickets or goods from the Airpoint Store. **By connecting your personal Airpoints Account you will keep 100% of your miles in your personal airpoints account AND contribute 20% additional airpoints to Enspiral.**

### How to:

 - Login to your personal Airpoints Account
 - go to **Airpoints™ for Business, and Join the Business Program**
