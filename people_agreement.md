# People Agreement

This document describes how individuals can relate with Enspiral and defines how people can join or leave the network.

### Relationships
The Enspiral collective is composed of Contributors, who make up the bulk of the community, and Members.

Members are Contributors who act as stewards and guardians of the collective and are responsible for maintaining our culture and purpose.

The official list of Members and Contributors is maintained [here](https://docs.google.com/a/enspiral.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ahr3iqrIRxyQdGtmc3kwZE9fZWIzYTI2Q25xWmoxN3c&usp=sharing#gid=0).

### Contributors
At our heart Enspiral is nothing more than a group of people (our Contributors) and the relationships between them. The collective exists to help each Contributor succeed in maximising their positive social and environmental impact. 

#### Joining Process
Any Member can invite a new person to become a contributor. Prospective Contributors are invited to Google Plus, Loomio and Slack. They initially have 3 months to evaluate the network. At the end of 3 months they are invited to become a Contributor and pay $90 / year towards our core costs. If money is a barrier we offer fee exemptions as needed.

#### Leaving Process
* Contributor asks to be removed or does not respond to the annual confirmation that they wish to be a Contributor.
* a consensus decision of Members can remove a contributor.

#### Expectations
A contributor is expected to contribute to the collective and participate on our comms channels and in group decisions. They participate in our internal gift economy and freely give their time to help other Contributors and actively help build Enspiral - sometimes individuals need to focus intensely on a single project, but overall we expect contributors to make the effort to engage with the wider group. 

### Members
Getting membership is like becoming a citizen of the collective. Members are the stewards and protectors of Enspiral and put aside self-interest to act as Kaitiaki for the whole. Members each have one share in the Enspiral Foundation, and therefore collectively own it, and are invited into the Member’s Loomio group. 

#### Joining Process
1. One or more members nominate a person for membership
1. Consensus decision of members to approve a nomination

#### Leaving Process
* Member resigns, once every six months we have a formal checkin to reconnect with the values of Membership and create a space for people to step back if the time is right.
* 75% majority vote of members may forcibly remove a member.

#### Expectations
In addition to the expectations of regular Contributors we expect that Members will engage on Loomio, participate in events when they can and attend most bi-monthly Members meetings.

### What does it mean to be an Enspiral Member?
We expect our members to uphold the Enspiral values below and actively protect and nurture the collective culture. Members make sure we stay true to our purpose and make the hard decisions that arise from time to time.

Ultimate power in the collective is held by our members. Enspiral mostly runs as a collection of autonomous units, and members are rarely asked to intervene or make decisions. But at the end of the day they control all the money and shares, and they decide which people and companies can join Enspiral and can force people to leave. They can hire and fire the Foundation directors and permanent staff and they can even rewrite the constitution of Enspiral itself.

### Values
Members are people who walk the talk of Enspiral and live the values of Integrity, Purpose, Commitment, Generosity, Good Judgement, Leadership, Engagement and Collaboration.

#### Integrity
To be a Member means to be trustworthy and to have a high level of personal integrity. Honesty and doing the right thing are just the starting point - true integrity means knowing who we are, what we value, and integrating that with our words and actions. We speak our truth even when it is unpopular and we do not compromise on what is important.

#### Purpose
We fundamentally believe our role on this planet is one of contribution - we are here to build a better world. We are idealistic, and we are pragmatic. We are people motivated by the heart and we act with considered intelligence. We love fun and new ways to do things, and we can persevere through the hard times as we understand things worth doing aren’t always easy. We are here to make a difference.

#### Commitment
Enspiral is really important to our members. For some of us it is our life’s work; for others it is our sole source of income. For all of us it is a big part of our lives and way up our priority list of where we put our energy. 

#### Generosity
We give freely of our time and money to help others - this doesn’t mean we will go broke giving what we don’t have, but our natural impulse is to share. We make sacrifices to help those around us and actively look for opportunities to create and share abundance.

#### Good Judgement
When we offer someone membership we are giving them a binding vote in the most important decisions we face as a collective so we better be sure their judgement is sound. Everyone has their own areas of expertise and experience but on the whole we look for people who make good decisions.

#### Leadership
Our members don’t sit around and talk about what someone else should do to make things better - we act. That means we don’t always ask permission before starting something new and risk public failure striving for difficult dreams. Everyone should lead some of the time, no one should lead all the time and leadership should be balanced with active followership.

#### Engagement
In order for us to realise the benefits of distributed power and diverse viewpoints, people need to participate in decision making and discussion. It’s understandable that people get busy at times and step back temporarily, but overall engagement is important. This might mean jumping in on Loomio, attending members meetings, going to retreats, recruiting and supporting new people, and participating in Collaborative Funding.

#### Collaboration
We love autonomy and self determination, but one fundamental premise of Enspiral is that we can add more value working together than on our own. If someone in their hearts is a lone wolf and doesn’t think we can build something better by working together, then membership of this collective is not for them.
