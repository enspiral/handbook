<p>6.3 A quorum for a meeting of shareholders is present if 60% or more of the total number of shareholders are present in person or by proxy.</p>
<p>6.4 No proxy is effective in relation to a meeting unless a copy of the notice of appointment is produced to the Company at least 48 hours before the time for holding the meeting or adjourned meeting at which the person named in the notice proposes to vote. If the written notice appointing a proxy is signed under power of attorney, a copy of the power of attorney (unless already deposited with the Company) and a signed certificate of non revocation of the power of attorney must accompany the notice.</p>
