# New contributor activation program

This is an experiment that is currently being run with new contributors.

## What is it for?
This programme aims is to support new contributors to become quickly active in the community through a "learning by doing" process. 
It consists in completing a list of easy / intermediate / hard challenges that will help any new contributor know more about Enspiral processes, people and culture. 

What are the challenges?

### Easy challenges

- Enspiral processes
  - join a working group
  - give feedback on the activation programme
- Enspiral people
  - attend an in person enspiral event
  - interview an old timer
- Enspiral culture and ideas
  - write a blog post
  - create a loomio thread
  - share something that excites you on Facebook group / watercooler channel

### Intermediate challenges
- update the handbook
- create an improvement ticket
- create a bucket in cobudget
- get paid from a bucket
- complete an improvement ticket (alone or with someone else)

### Harder challenges
- steward a new contributor through the activation programme
- find paying work for someone enspiral

## What is the experiment process?
The experiment was kicked off at the beginning of sprint 30, with a loomio invitation to recruit initial voluntary participants. We will be holding fortnightly check-in threads in slack and tracking engagement with a monthly survey to get feedback from the participants. 

Here are the success criteria we will be assessing:

- How many people opt in to the experiment
- How many challenges people complete
- How much all the participants felt part of the community after completing some/all challenges
- How easy to use all the participants found it
- How much support participants receive to complete the challenges.

This chapter will eventually be a whole section with different pages.
