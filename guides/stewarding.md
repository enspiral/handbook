# Stewarding

Since the adoption of the [stewardship agreement](/agreements/stewardship.md), we're in a process to give stewards to all members, new contributors, and anyone else who wants one.

As this process gets underway, the intention is to update this guide with what we learn about processes and guidelines.

## Stewarding circle

We've offered to kickstart stewarding relationships for all active Contributors ([discussion here](https://www.loomio.org/d/txvesKRb/)):

## Resources

[How to steward well](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19jtWPBeQvNM7uhbCjtd4JBjFtxH_RzX0Z87Qmdu8xa4/edit?usp=sharing), shared by Chelsea Robinson, provides a great starting place for stewards and stewardees alike, and is especially useful in getting a new steward relationship started.

The [stewarding system within Loomio](https://loomio.gitbooks.io/loomio-cooperative-handbook/content/stewarding.html) is another good starting place if you want to learn about stewarding in practice.

## Matchmaking

Matchmaking happens in batches roughly once a year; if you're keen to jump in at this moment, though, you may be able to get connected with a steward if you ask in the [Stewarding slack channel](https://enspiral.slack.com/messages/C6649VCKF/details/).
