## Why Git?

We use Git because it is an amazing structured collaboration process that enables thousands of people to work on projects without central coordination. There is a learning curve but it is worth the effort.

Git is like a central collaboration trunk with a million services that work on top of it.

The first one we use is **Github**: it's a hosting service for Git repositories.

**Gitbooks** is another service we use: it turns all the files you see on [github.com/enspiral/handbook](http://github.com/enspiral/handbook) into the nice browsable, searchable, portable package you can see at [handbook.enspiral.com](http://handbook.enspiral.com).

## Git lingo: issues, repos, pull requests, and merging

**Repo** is short for **repository**: in Git, all the files for a project live in a repo.

A **Github issue** is a public discussion for work-in-progress.

So for instance, when I see something wrong with Loomio, I go to [the Loomio repo on Github](http://github.com/loomio/loomio/issues) and say "I found a bug, this thing is broken!" Then we have a discussion about how to fix it. Sometime later someone can propose a fix, and reference the issue, so when the proposal is accepted, the issue gets closed.

In git lingo, the proposal is a **pull request** and it is accepted by **merging** in the changes.

## Put your new Git skills to good use

Now that you have some Git skills, why don't you try [proposing a change to this handbook](../#contributing-to-the-handbook), or [suggesting a new issue on the Improvements board](https://github.com/enspiral/handbook/tree/d3234f4c1fe3afc87e5231beeb2d3926aee696d2/guides/improvements.html)

If you have any questions that aren't answered by this guide, you can ask them by [creating a new issue](https://github.com/enspiral/handbook/issues/new).
