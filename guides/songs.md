# Enspiral Songs

“[…] Whenever humans come together for any reason, music is there […]” - **Daniel Levitin**

At gatherings and events like [Retreats](/guides/retreats.md) social activities can be an important part of developing culture and group identity. At some events singing has been used to welcome and farewell the attendees, and as part of sharing circles.

The Flourishing Fellows & the Lifehack team sang this [waiata](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9E065ftX1PU) to open their final hui in 2015.
