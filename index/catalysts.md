# Catalysts

[_WG Status_](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RQrZE_9iw0ewIj7UCvC7SBLCziYwfi13vM5FbRDBCx4/edit?usp=sharing)_: Vibrant_

## How Catalysts Work

We're governed by the [Catalyst Agreement](https://github.com/enspiral/handbook/tree/d3234f4c1fe3afc87e5231beeb2d3926aee696d2/agreements/catalyst.html)

Current catalysts are: john gieryn and Joriam Philipe.

Current catalyst supporters are: Susan Basterfield, Joshua Vial, Teddy Taptiklis, and Phoebe Tickell. The catalyst supporters are invited to hold more strongly the responsibility of selection, support, and – most importantly – funding of Catalysts, but are aided by the Catalysts.

Catalysts operate on 2 week sprints.

We keep the network up-to-date through the regular "Enspiral Video Updates". we also work to ensure that relevant news goes out through our newsletter. _Videos from the previous catalyst cohort may be found on_ [_our Youtube channel_](https://www.youtube.com/user/enspiral/videos).

All catalyst work is tracked on the [the Improvements board](https://trello.com/b/btHeb35m/enspiral-improvements-board?menu=filter&filter=label:wg-catalyst). You can see completed work, and a full archive, [on github](https://github.com/enspiral/improvements/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+).

We try to take notes in all our meetings, and share them in the Slack channel [\#wg-catalysts](https://enspiral.slack.com/messages/wg-catalysts/).

### What are we doing

#### Update 2019-11-06

Here's a quick-list of key Catalyst contributions \(the snapshot below further illustrates our work, in essence, if not exactly\)

* **Retreats:** sustaining this vital heartbeat via Winter and Summer Retreats \(in a way that no longer burns people out\)
* **Assembly Sprints:** keeping momentum between events, these digital happenings have supported us to easily pass 3 or 4 agreements and get a bunch of key collective work done
* **Pods:** our initial experiments are proving fruitful, new Contributors have called it "key" to their experience in joining us, and longer-timers have found it a lovely way to keep in contact, give back, etc.
* **Communications:** Catalysts work to keep the network talking to each other. As is the nature of our network, we all can get consumed by our work. This can leave the network feeling a bit too quiet, cause worthwhile initiatives to be dropped, and make it more difficult for people to engage with the network at the level they want.
* **Working Groups:** upkeep of documentation, support, and more.
* _Others:_ include external funding and storytelling efforts \(eg, MoneySwarm, StoryDojo...\)

#### Snapshot of john's priorities as of 12 October, 2018

![catalyst priorities, with Peer Support, Clarity, and Retreats as priorities or &quot;the big sticks I&apos;m chewing&quot;](https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1905/45274411111_b563716ae0_b.jpg)

* Capacity development of groups and individuals, and relationship-building.
* Sense-making \(maintaining context\).
* Growing our habits of reflection and retrospectives.
* We help [working groups](./) to form and maintain good health and working relationships.
* We remind people of the things they said they would do.
* We encourage people to contribute, e.g. by matching people to opportunities, or inviting individuals to contribute on specific tasks.
* We maintain our own internal rhythm, which everyone else can sync up with if its useful.
* We do things until we can delegate or automate them.
* We maintain an overview of all the working groups in the network so we can help direct people's attention.
* We act as theatre attendants, supporting people - new or returning - to find a place of meaningful contribution or benefit for them.
