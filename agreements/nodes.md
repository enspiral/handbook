# Enspiral Nodes Agreement

An Enspiral node is a formal subgroup of Enspiral that has the power to manage their agreements, processes and finances independently.

The board is responsible for creating and maintaining the Node Requirements (below) which are required to outline the requirements for starting, running and closing a node. 

The board has the power to approve requests for new Nodes and dissolve inactive / rogue Nodes.

## Node Hosts

Each node is expected to have at least two node hosts who are responsible for communicating with the board and the wider network.

## Joining / leaving process

A node has the power to invite a new person to join Enspiral. Each member of a node is automatically a member of the global network. 

A node also has the power to force one of their members to leave the network. While this power is expected to be used infrequently it is an important safeguard to protect the wider community.

## Independent Finances

A node may have finances independent from the Foundation and receive all membership fees from their members directly. 

A node may also opt to have membership fees go directly to the foundation if they do not want the overheads of managing their own financial infrastructure.

## Multi-node membership

An Enspiral member may be part of multiple Nodes. Membership of multiple nodes is encouraged and such people act as important connectors in the wider network.

# Node Requirements

These guidelines can be changed by the board through an advice process.

*First iteration of node guidelines coming soon*
