# Email Accounts Agreement

* Any Member or Catalyst is entitled to an @enspiral address.
* They pay an additional annual fee to the foundation which is set by the board. See the current cost at the [Email accounts guide](https://github.com/enspiral/handbook/blob/Ops-updates/guides/email_accounts.md)
* Any Contributor with an active subscription \(full or subsidized\) can keep their email address regardless of how / when they received it.
* Catalysts can decide exceptions to the rule

This agreement was formed through the Assembly Sprint \| April 2019 via this [Loomio thread](https://www.loomio.org/d/tLkZUOV5/email-accounts-agreement)
